# Building a Django RESTful API

This repo is the result of following a [highly readable tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-rest-api-with-django-a-test-driven-approach-part-1) 
covering building an API using Test-Driven Development techniques, provided by [Jee Gikera](https://pub.scotch.io/@jee) at [scotch.io](scotch.io)

Further development should include adding user addition and authentication, documentation and developing more refined tests.
